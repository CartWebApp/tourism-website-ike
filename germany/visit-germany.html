                <h2>Travel within Germany</h2>
                <h3>Trains</h3>
                <p>Deutsche Bahn operates Europe's largest railway system using eco-conscious methods, running 100% renewable power. The trains have an extensive network of long-distance, they can be fairly expensive but can be cheaper with deals.</p>

                <h3>Buses</h3>
                <p>Buses are cheaper but slower than trains, with growing long-haul networks. Bus prices are allotted according to zones, one-way tickets starting at 1.40 EUR for short rides and up to 10.80 EUR for longer rides. Cities and regions are connected via 400 routes with around 6,000 journeys per week. The journey is cheap and the CO2 emissions are low.</p>

                <h3>Bicycle</h3>
                <p>Cycling is allowed on all roads and highways except autobahns. There are plenty of places for dedicated bike routes, more than 40,000 miles of bike trails in cities and countryside. Some are scenic like the rides along the Rhine and Danuhbe Rivers. Tourists don't have to buy a bike, they can be borrowed inexpensively for a short time from bike sharing programs like Call a Bike and Next Bike.</p>
