                        <h2>Overview</h2>
                        <p>Before visiting Germany, tourists should know the many aspects of German society, whether you're interested in the culture, or just looking to have fun. Germany is a central European country, a friendly place with a rich culture. THe most popular cities for tourists are Berlin, Munich, Hamburg, Nuremberg, and Neuschwanstein. Berlin is the capital of the country with 3,664,088 million people living in the city. Many visit the Berlin or the Holocaust memorial. The wall is significant as it was a barrier between North and East Germany for twenty. The wall eventually was knocked down on Nov. 9 1989 and kept as a monument.</p>

                        <h2>History</h2>
                        <p>The formation of modern Germany took place under the helmsmanship of one its largest monarchies, Prussia, through the nineteenth century. <a href="https://history.state.gov/countries/germany">History.state.gov</a> states the German empire establishment recognized the Prussian King, Otto Von Bismarck, as the German Emperor in 1871, and the US would recognize the new German Empire. Germany unified under his leadership, and that came along with a new constitution. The constitution created a national parliament and extended the emperor's power. The country would split after WW2 as the west became the Federal Republic, under the control of the US, France, and Britain while the Soviet controlled in the East. The construction of the Berlin wall ended the flight of people from East to West Germany in 1961 while west Germany had rapid economic growth. Germans from both sides would tear down the Berlin wall, following would be the Russians and allied troops to finally leave Berlin.

                        <h2>Beer</h2>
                        <p>The common stereotype about Germans and their culture is their love of beer, and it's true! <a href="https://github.com/CartWebApp/tourism-website-ike">Germany.travel</a> claims statistically every German drank 95 liters of beer in 2020. THe reason Germans drink so much beer has to do with their history and the laws. Beer served as a healthy substitute for water, which was usually contaminated. Still even beer itself still had questionable ingredients until the Purity Law. The purity Law was made over 500 years ago, and regulated ingredients: only water, malt, and hops. Yeast was an ingredient added later.</p>
