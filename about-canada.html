                <h1> About Canada</h1>
                <h2>Culture In The Country</h2>
                    <p>The country of Canada has diverse culture depending on the province. Events can be enjoyed by a variety of all ages, though some may cater to the younger crowd than others. Millions of tourists are attracted every year. The country's landscape is moistly plains, as cities are normally closer to the border.</p>
                       <p>One such example is the province of Alberta. This province is home to the Calgary Stampede, an event that has occured since 1923 as a whole. The website <a href="https://www.canadiansky.co.uk/alberta-holidays/calgary/experiencing-the-calgary-stampede">Canadian Sky</a> sources the event's beginning all the way back to 1886. <a href="https://www.calgarystampede.com/stampede/about"> The offical website</a> of the Calgary Stampede references the fact that the event itself provides jobs to thousands of youth in the city, as well as hosts over 1,000 businesses. The Calgary Stampede is also one of the city's most notable traditions. The event takes place in the middle of July, and lasts 10 days total. There are many festivities and competitons at the event, including but not limited to; the rodeo, freestyle motorcross, and the dog bowl. If traveling to Canada, the Calgary Stampede is a must see!!  </p>
                       <p> Another example of differing culture based on province is the province of Quebec. The province of Quebec's biggest event could arguably be the holiday of St. Jean Baptiste Day. <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Fete-Nationale-du-Quebec">Britannica</a> sources the event to be a celebration of the patron saint to French Canadians, Jean Baptiste, and it takes place on June 24. The event is one of the biggest in Quebec, and is a massive show of their culture. <a href="https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/la-fete-nationale-du-quebec-saint-jean-baptiste-day">The Canadian Encyclopedia</a> cites the event having the national anthem, "O Canada" having its origns at this festival in 1880. <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/kidscbc2/the-feed/learn-all-about-this-french-canadian-celebration">CBS Kids</a>states this event held its first celebration in 1834, and began as an offical event in 1925. The event has festivites ranging from concerts, fireworks, and other hiuge displays. When celebrating, people chant "Bonne Saint-Jean-Baptiste!", which translates to "Happy St-Jean-Baptiste!"</p>
