                        <p> One of the best times to visit St Petersburg is between May and July because of its <a href="https://www.onthegotours.com/us/Russia/Guide-to-the-White-Nights-Festival">White Nights festival</a> which makes the vacation of every tourist a memorable one. This <a href="https://www.planeteu.com/events/white-nights-festival/">enriching festival</a> is a festival celebrated with the purpose of making music art and dance a part of their culture. The term 'white nights' refers to a natural phenomenon more commonly known as the midnight sun. It occurs during the summer months around both poles, north of the Arctic Circle and south of the Antarctic Circle.
                        </p>
      
                        <p> During this time tourists will not only get to see performers in every corner spending the night entertaining the passer-by, but will also get to see top class Russian performers giving their best performances in various theaters. Also some of the city’s most prestigious museums and art galleries are open overnight during the festival. A perfect visit for any artists or people who apprentice theater arts.

                        <p> The <a href="https://www.56thparallel.com/maslenitsa-festival/">Maslenitsa festival</a>, also called the pancake festival, is celebrated by eating and tasting pancakes for a whole week. This festival celebrates the farewell of winter and the dawn of spring. It is well-known for its seven days of festivities and final dose of gluttony, as it marks the last few days of consuming milk and eggs. <a href="https://www.expresstorussia.com/experience-russia/maslenitsa-in-russia.html">Maslenitsa</a> contains both pagan and Christian traditions and is celebrated in the last week before the seventh week before Eastern Orthodox Easter. 
                        </p>
      
                        <p> If tourists visit Russia during this time there will be carnival-like celebrations going on everywhere for the entire week and tourists can eat many fresh pancakes, or blinis. People can also witness the burning session of a straw structure which locals call ‘Lady Maslenitsa’. This practice has become an almost iconic symbol of the festival, and the imminent end of winter.
